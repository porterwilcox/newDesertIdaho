    nationalEmpire = `
    Hungry and afraid they soldiered onward </br>
    Finding peace in the simplest of things— </br>
    A cumulus picture in the expansive blue afternoon sky,
    The greening yard of an early Idaho spring, <br />
    Flowers, so beautiful, vivid, and real. <br />
    Heroically they survived the dying days <br />
    Of the greatest national empire of debt <br />
    The multiverse could create, yet <br />
    The vicious cycle would start anew, as <br />
    The banking cartel strictly enforced <br />
    The use of their new global money, <br />
    Mayer Anselm Rothschild’s ancestor <br />
    Repeating from his island pink palace <br />
    That he who controls the money supply <br />
    Cares not who makes the laws.`

    sansAnesthesia = `
    With god-like furry, and <br />
    The temperament of a rogue wave, <br />
    He steeled himself against the others. <br />
    How dare they be unaware <br />
    Of the devilish plot <br />
    To marginalize, separate, and shear. <br />
    Fear and worry strangled dissents, <br />
    Almost all became witting accomplices <br />
    To their own confinements, yet <br />
    The virulent debasements did sneak past them <br />
    In the night of hundred year scheme, <br />
    Bankers, business, politicians dissected them <br />
    Sans anesthesia. <br />
    Most were pleased for the scraps <br />
    Tossed to them from under the table, <br />
    He was not. <br />
    He committed to stand with Julian, <br />
    As truth will break their spines.`

    missteps = `
    From missteps of good intentions <br />
    The wanderer became unwelcome <br />
    In his trek through gray-brown desert. <br />
    Sagebrush began to whistle insults as he walked, <br />
    The wind was unrelenting, gritty, oppressive, <br />
    And a cold spring rainstorm pelted his face, <br />
    Wearing him out, <br />
    Weighing him down, <br />
    Chafing his every step. <br />
    Eventually he stumbled on a downslope, and fell, <br />
    Landing hard upon a crooked rock, <br />
    Injured and unsure. <br />
    After a moment of uncertainty <br />
    He stood, <br />
    Tall and fierce, <br />
    Knowing it would take infinitely more <br />
    To break his resolute, western spirit.
    `

    falseHorizon = `
    The sun sank, expectedly, <br />
    Into the false horizon of our time. <br />
    So much human folly, misery <br />
    For no better reason <br />
    Than centralized control of money, <br />
    A tragic decision, <br />
    And the invisible enemy, <br />
    A virus, <br />
    The tiniest of things <br />
    Setting free the avalanche.  
    `

    hereBefore = `
    In a forested backyard in desert Idaho, <br />
    A late October chill confirms the autumn colors, <br />
    Leaves, lying in a portrait on the dulling grass, <br />
    Dogs chasing squirrels in viscous sprints, and <br />
    Soft light still shallow in its orbit. <br />
    Today will be unlike the others, <br />
    Laughter, like just before the news, when <br />
    Looking out the window in a forested backyard <br />
    In a desert town in Idaho, on a <br />
    Late October morning with a chill, <br />
    Autumn colors — leaves, lying in a portrait — and<br />
    Light shadows flickering from the apple tree branches. <br />
    Maybe I have been here before.  
    `

    toCare = `
    As I turn eyes westward<br />
    A deeply penetrating orange light,<br />
    Tangled in the hilltop trees,<br />
    Brings a smile to Heraclitus and me.<br />
    There’s fire-light running wild through the universe,<br />
    Setting sun, late April Idaho brisk wind,<br />
    Hiking trails; time.<br />
    Hemingway never forgot his first love, the<br />
    Memory of her more beautiful, abstract,<br />
    Each passing day.<br />
    Maybe our purpose is simple—<br />
    To care, contribute, and<br />
    Witness the splendor.  
    `

    chaosOfRipples = `
    Ice appeared on the river’s banks today, and<br />
    On the tops of rocks in the current,<br />
    Changing the course of the world, from<br />
    That which was, to<br />
    That which now is, the<br />
    Chaos of ripples shimmering then disappearing<br />
    At the whim of cold passing clouds<br />
    In the shallow morning sun.<br />
    The river taught him years ago that<br />
    Destiny is shaped by innumerable complexities,<br />
    Owing nothing to precedence or righteousness, and<br />
    Takes all routes to the same end, simultaneously.<br />
    If you stop thinking for a moment, and<br />
    Truly observe and listen,<br />
    Nature will teach you what it means to be human,<br />
    Allowing you to levitate just above the ground,<br />
    For a while. 
    `

    crippledInSpirit = `
    It was two hours before sky-dark<br />
    When the badger was defeated,<br />
    Crippled in spirit,<br />
    Awkwardly bruised from the imperial battle,<br />
    Humbled by the more capable creature<br />
    Hell-bent on shaping the mountain<br />
    In the image of its rage.<br />
    A bird, soaring kingly in the ocean-gray sky,<br />
    Observed the badger’s thrashing<br />
    Through the autumn evening rain haze,<br />
    Predicting the astringent badger would become<br />
    Disloyal in character, acidic, unwell.<br />
    In time, sadly, the badger proved the bird true,<br />
    Plotting with a doltish, clumsy raven<br />
    The humiliated badger prepared an attack<br />
    To malign the bird’s account of the beating.<br />
    Unbeknownst to the badger the spying eyes<br />
    Of an eagle from afar also bore witness,<br />
    Saving the bird from unholy disparage<br />
    Claimed by the deficient duo.<br />
    Sullen, the badger went back to its hole in the ground,<br />
    The dimwitted raven knew not what to think.  
    `

    primordialRoutine = `
    The fire light of desert sunrise,<br />
    Lambent on the proud east walls of Red Rock Canyon,<br />
    Repeats its primordial routine, dancing<br />
    Over Spanish tiled roofs, palm trees, cactus.<br />
    Oh, day— you are a peculiar stage—<br />
    And I the lucky one<br />
    To witness on a simple morning<br />
    A quiet sunrise, and<br />
    The ancient sky now peopled with airplanes<br />
    Jetting triangle dreams that fade colors to blue.<br />
    For a period of time<br />
    When the sun is narrowly above the horizon<br />
    The city between us disappears<br />
    From the overpowering brightness of our star, yet<br />
    Against all probability<br />
    I am here.<br />
    Today, anew.<br />
    In this grand opera of sunlight<br />
    And theater.  
    `

    aBeautifulLife = `
    Maria Flores knew only a beautiful life,<br />
    The flowered walls of her father’s Mexico estate<br />
    Sheltered her from the pallid faces and<br />
    Barrio clutter scattered about the village.<br />
    Maria knew the sweet taste of fresh cornbread<br />
    Peppered with green chiles grown in her garden;<br />
    She knew her papa’s laugh, his smile, his kind voice.<br />
    Maria knew many nice things, and such is a<br />
    Lucky childhood, to be the recipient<br />
    Of a great effort to protect innocence, her<br />
    Father’s aim to barricade her from incivility, and<br />
    Foster an environment of creativity and love.<br />
    Still, the world has a way of falling apart, if only<br />
    To be reborn with new vigor.<br />
    The entire village was stunned by the accusation,<br />
    Assuredly false, that Maria’s father was guilty, then<br />
    Sentenced to be hanged.<br />
    The tears flowed as though Thales of Miletus<br />
    Found the source of his watery archê in Maria.<br />
    Her papa was gone.<br />
    Her happy childhood abruptly ended. Yet,<br />
    Maria’s newly ashen heart was determined<br />
    To beat vibrant-red again someday.<br />
    She would live to make her papa proud, for<br />
    He taught her—<br />
    A beautiful life is a choice.
    `

    questionTime = `
    He walks slowly along the Socratic forest trail<br />
    Happily enjoying several steps without pain,<br />
    The ritual of ontological contemplation<br />
    Coloring nature green, as the<br />
    First autumn yellow leaves question time.<br />
    Amid the placid freedom is awareness<br />
    Of the river song shaping the rocks, but also<br />
    Acknowledgement of the dark empire’s evil energy<br />
    Dropping bombs on innocent children for profit.<br />
    How unjust is this paradise offering moments of<br />
    Windless warmth from our benevolent star, while<br />
    Terrorizing untold peoples for differing politics?<br />
    Maybe injustice cannot be banished, but<br />
    Indifference to unnecessary suffering allows<br />
    Those that control the money supply<br />
    To continue their unconscionable experiments.<br />
    Decentralize money for more fairness. 
    `

    flaubertianStruggle = `
    Our time here is so tender, yet cruel, a type of<br />
    Flaubertian struggle to be sure. For the<br />
    Same riverbank water blessing the tree<br />
    Undercuts its roots flowing round the bend,<br />
    Precipitating an overearly death, as the tree<br />
    Falls in slow motion<br />
    Toward that which giveth and taketh away,<br />
    Its life source, and saboteur.<br />
    Knowing intensifies the grief.  
    `

    socialAmnesia = `
    The desert knows it to be true<br />
    That we’re much older<br />
    Than our memories permit us to be, that<br />
    Wind lifts birds free from the tree, and<br />
    Rapids make storied kayak streams.<br />
    What if our nature was peaceful, serene?<br />
    Hiking over cactus<br />
    Hiking, hiking over cactus, over cactus.<br />
    The human story is perhaps incomplete,<br />
    Maybe there existed more beautiful people<br />
    Smiling and praying in families of antiquity<br />
    Than science asks us to believe,<br />
    Ravens scream murderous themes.<br />
    Take every chance for love dear flower<br />
    Stand tall and be brave in all weather, for a<br />
    Taurid meteor might cause social amnesia,<br />
    Tomorrow's unimaginable loss of our<br />
    Triumphs, miseries, collective history,<br />
    As those that happened before us<br />
    Evanescent in the ether between stars.
