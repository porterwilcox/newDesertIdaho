    aMenacingKnight = `
    A menacing knight, suspecting his stealthy approach a success,<br />
    Lunges ferociously at the slumbering dragon<br />
    In a misguided holy quest for glory.<br />
    The peaceful dragon, somewhat surprised by the foolhardy attack,<br />
    Tears the silly head from the knights body with ease<br />
    And places it near his writhing red body and sword.<br />
    A look of surprise can be seen in the dead man's eyes for a time,<br />
    But a heavy heart has no claim on the gentle beast.
