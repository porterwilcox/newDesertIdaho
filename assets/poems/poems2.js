    aMenacingKnight = `
    A menacing knight, suspecting his stealthy approach a success,<br />
    Lunges ferociously at the slumbering dragon<br />
    In a misguided holy quest for glory.<br />
    The peaceful dragon, somewhat surprised by the foolhardy attack,<br />
    Tears the silly head from the knights body with ease<br />
    And places it near his writhing red body and sword.<br />
    A look of surprise can be seen in the dead man's eyes for a time,<br />
    But a heavy heart has no claim on the gentle beast.   
    `

    aStranger = `
    A stranger walks unknown in foreign lands<br />
    To everyone but himself.<br />
    Passing by a storefront he sees his own reflection<br />
    And nods at the man with acquaintance,<br />
    A smile is returned in kind.  
    `

    windPaints = `
    Wind paints the frozen Alaska sky in sharp lines<br />
    Extending the blistering snow beyond the rugged peaks<br />
    Like arms reaching skyward in morning stretch,<br />
    And uncloaking the often invisible demarcation<br />
    Of upslope wind and dangerous recirculation<br />
    That forms the snow cornice in space.<br />
    The bird knows the wind well,<br />
    He sees the varying flow with or without snow<br />
    And navigates the mountain ridges accordingly.   
    `

    birds = `
    Birds make a thin distinction<br />
    Between the organized folly<br />
    Of people and ants marching furiously fast<br />
    Towards an uncertain end<br />
    With a seriousness that undermines<br />
    Real joy along the way.  
    `

    boundariesAreDrawn = `
    Boundaries are drawn on a map,<br />
    Then redrawn a thousand times more before the end,<br />
    In a struggle that is perfectly human,<br />
    Trekking near to the mirage of security<br />
    During times of new anthems and fashion,<br />
    On a planet that doesn’t take sides with the victor.<br />
    Last I checked we both breathe the air<br />
    And wake from sweet dreams with fresh smiles on occasion,<br />
    And worry about things we discuss in soft voices,<br />
    And plead with the sky to spare our disaster.<br />
    When the final time-lapse is viewed at high speed<br />
    Please let there be no lines between people.   
    `

    chaseAfterTheMystery = `
    A child asks of the old groundskeeper<br />
    Watering graceful gardens<br />
    In amber desert sun,<br />
    “Do you like watering trees?<br />
    There are so many,<br />
    It must take forever.”<br />
    “There’s more to it than that,”<br />
    Says the strong man with a kind voice,<br />
    “Watering trees<br />
    Waters more than the trees,<br />
    It gives life to memories.<br />
    I think it’s very nice, and<br />
    I’m okay with that too.<br />
    … Run along now,” the man motions with a wave,<br />
    “Chase after the mystery,<br />
    Look farther ahead than behind, and<br />
    Watch out for rocks along the way.”  
    `

    fromTheBow = `
    From the bow of a great and mighty ship,<br />
    In a blackness mirrored by the moonless water,<br />
    A profound and humbling incomprehension<br />
    With the vastness of space<br />
    Overwhelmed and mystified me;<br />
    I became unbalanced in complete and terrifying wonderment<br />
    Of the countless twinkling little lights<br />
    Mapping their ancient riddled exhalations<br />
    Across the universe to the sea.  
    `

    iFeelDifferently = `
    I feel differently now<br />
    Looking back on my life,<br />
    About the risks I ventured in youth—<br />
    When time was more likely,<br />
    And strength more complete,<br />
    When patience was weaker,<br />
    And love everlasting, so I thought.<br />
    Now the movie replaying in my tired mind<br />
    Is mostly familiar smiling faces<br />
    Laughing,<br />
    Uncontrollable laughing,<br />
    And the rain—<br />
    The wretched damn rain<br />
    The cold day that you died,<br />
    And the new wildflowers<br />
    That bloomed the next spring.   
    `

    letTheWater = `
    Let the water move you<br />
    Not the other way around,<br />
    So that your efforts are rewarded<br />
    In a living connection with nature,<br />
    Which is near to grace and beauty.<br />
    Do not force your will upon the river,<br />
    Which is a temporary victory,<br />
    Rather, rejoice in that line of water<br />
    That tracks safely through the boulders<br />
    And beyond the horizon line.   
    `

    andWhat = `
    And what about your fixation with the past?<br />
    Does it ever subside?<br />
    Asked the man of himself.<br />
    Not really, not often, not truly, answered he.<br />
    And the record skipped back with a squeal,<br />
    To the worn groove it sings in the song.  
    `

    hopsVines = `
    Hops vines climb the patio posts<br />
    Reaching the brown lattice stained top<br />
    Creating a network of shadows below<br />
    That codes new laughter and passion,<br />
    As years pass by in a desert sunset. 
    `

    aManWalkingAlone = `
    A tired man walking alone in the desert<br />
    Happened upon a bird not startled by his approach<br />
    So the curious man asked the bird how to fly,<br />
    The old desert bird politely described what he could‒<br />
    How he flapped his fledging wings for hours upon hours<br />
    Afraid he wouldn’t survive the first height.<br />
    Time passed and his patience diminished<br />
    From long restless days in the nest,<br />
    Until finally one day when he thought he was ready<br />
    Deciding to give flight a try.<br />
    The young bird steadied his nerve, and<br />
    Hopped near to the edge<br />
    Then lost suddenly his footing and fell,<br />
    Crashing quickly toward rocks and soil<br />
    He spread his wings hard,<br />
    Bracing for certain demise.<br />
    How frightening, said the man, interrupting the story<br />
    Impressed by the birds explanation,<br />
    Thinking himself close to the knowledge of flight.<br />
    Yes, very scary indeed, said the bird,<br />
    A very close call with disaster,<br />
    But that has nothing to do with how to fly,<br />
    And gets you no nearer the answer.<br />
    It probably won’t make much sense to you, said the wise bird<br />
    But after all these years in the sky<br />
    I know it’s less about wings than the wind.   
    `

    aThousand = `
    A thousand men fight<br />
    For the love of a queen<br />
    And kill for the love of control,<br />
    Plotting red death to a coward king on the run<br />
    Battered armies courageous in struggle,<br />
    Bishop takes pawn on f4.<br />
    ...Check.  
    `

    earth = `
    Earth has wild wants too,<br />
    Evolving art-life forms unending<br />
    Replacing desert canvas for new shades of green<br />
    Eroding rocky coastline with sandy beach dreams<br />
    Loving the forest in fresh flowing streams<br />
    Breathing sharp snow-topped arete mountain scenes<br />
    Carving canyon deep feelings in minds spinning free<br />
    Caressing her lover in orbiting rings<br />
    While rolling together in darkness.  
    `

    iRefuse = `
    I refuse to find a balance<br />
    In my love for you,<br />
    I want you all the way.  
    `

    heRan = `
    He ran with cold wind<br />
    Burning his skin,<br />
    Towards his sweet wife<br />
    Hurt by cruel words,<br />
    As the train departed their love.<br />
    In life sometimes you are late.   
    `

    theGreatDesire = `
    The great desire we all share<br />
    Is our want to love and be loved,<br />
    That’s why death stabs our hearts so sharply.<br />
    You don’t get over death<br />
    You just keep moving downstream—<br />
    Water in a river on a journey to the sea.  
    `

    thunderStorms = `
    Thunder storms darken the daylight<br />
    Bottles of vineyards pile deep<br />
    As lover’s emotions unstable<br />
    Promising curtains of rain and mischief.  
    `

    youWillKnowMe = `
    Written words<br />
    Will<br />
    Live on,<br />
    Beyond<br />
    My final heartbeat.<br />
    And from that horrible distance<br />
    You will know me<br />
    To be true.   
    `

    canyonAlpenglow = `
    Orange fades to canyon alpenglow<br />
    Hearkening hope in dim distant stars,<br />
    Emboldening embers impassioned in arms,<br />
    Flickering cracks, and bursts from heat throes,<br />
    Shifting winds and my thoughts down the slope<br />
    Of her back as we take off our clothes<br />
    Beneath naked skies only lovers have known.  
    `

    unexpectedDeparture = `
    Autumn rain wetted her hair<br />
    Soft, like a morning kiss,<br />
    Adding chill to the tragedy, and<br />
    Blistering every solemn footstep<br />
    As she walked alone in great grief<br />
    From an unexpected departure with love.  
    `

    desertDetermination = `
    A tired old tree<br />
    Born many years ago on the plateau,<br />
    Brittle with suffering from the warming desert, and<br />
    Unaware of a mass looming lasting displacement,<br />
    Holds firm to poor, thirsty earth<br />
    Hoping others are buttressed<br />
    By her desert determination to be, and<br />
    Uncertain her fate should she fail.   
    `

    bornInDryDesert = `
    Clouds mushroom sprout the horizon<br />
    Finding freedom in less pressure on high,<br />
    Splash blue with white elephant billows of love,<br />
    Turn dark as new monsters, and<br />
    Rage wild through the night.<br />
    Morphing sky white afternoon treasures<br />
    Born in dry desert air light,<br />
    Rise angry in evening late concert<br />
    Clapping bright thunder with lightning loud fright.  
    `

    firstRaindrops = `
    Maria Flores was born with an uncommon share of beauty,<br />
    Uncommon even for the beautiful women of Monterrey, Mexico.<br />
    She was born the same day the drought ended,<br />
    Her newborn tears spilling onto the hospital floor<br />
    As the first raindrops blessed the parched flora of her homeland;<br />
    Her wails the harbinger of the echoing thunder and lightning<br />
    That brightened the stormy city skyline.<br />
    When she was young Maria’s father would recount the night of her birth.<br />
    He said the fires that raged throughout the countryside that year<br />
    Were swallowed up by her spirit,<br />
    That she saved the city, and<br />
    Brought joy not only to her family but to an entire generation.<br />
    The story always made Maria feel special.<br />
    And such was her father’s talent,<br />
    To make her feel as though she were a gift to the world.  
    `

    rightNow = `
    It's a lie that time heals wounds,<br />
    It doesn't.<br />
    In fact, time itself is a great lie and doesn't exist.<br />
    Time is an ironical part of our subjective, conscious reality,<br />
    It doesn't exist outside our minds.<br />
    Things only ever happen right now<br />
    And the present moment is all you ever get.<br />
    The past is a memory and the future only a hope or fear,<br />
    But neither exists right now.  
    `

    objectiveView = `
    Birds feel for the wind<br />
    Bent willingly towards thermal skies<br />
    Ascending nearer an objective view<br />
    Of a planet wreaked in mayhem,<br />
    Spying a species killing and cruel,<br />
    Fighting for their color,<br />
    Fighting for their food,<br />
    Fighting over Gods<br />
    Created by their fears.<br />
    Soaring high above the desert<br />
    Birds know not to care, they find<br />
    Upwind freedom from the chaos<br />
    Crosswind freedom from the grind<br />
    Downwind freedom from the worries<br />
    Absorbed in peoples’ minds.<br />
    Birds say give me flight<br />
    Man says give me more,<br />
    Lift is grace upon their feathers<br />
    Wailing ailing tearstained faces,<br />
    Diving desert brown escarpments<br />
    Daily dying beneath bombardments,<br />
    Is a life for each to choose.<br />
    Birds feel for the wind.  
    `

    livePoetically = `
    Poetry is life in words.<br />
    Surely your life is poetry<br />
    If only you learned to love the words.<br />
    Words are meaning<br />
    Words are experiences<br />
    Beautiful, eternal, ethereal words make meanings memorable<br />
    And worth our might and struggle.<br />
    Write about your life, because<br />
    If you’re not telling a story you’re not living right.<br />
    Live poetically.  
    `

    yakutatBayCrossing = `
    The music grew louder, softer, the perfect pitch<br />
    From the fog gray front between heartbeat and not.<br />
    Committed? Yes!<br />
    What a slippery slope decisions and such,<br />
    And gravity the arbiter.<br />
    I am the test<br />
    Bravado no better than calm and sense of purpose.<br />
    Focus<br />
    Feel the waves alive within<br />
    Dare to trust.<br />
    The music serene, sublime, if even music there was.<br />
    Aware of all possible outcomes—<br />
    Frigid water, cold knowledge of people left behind<br />
    Eternally important.<br />
    But the music is life and together we dance,<br />
    The harmony so smooth, so clear<br />
    And nothing else.<br />
    Then, after a lifetime and no time<br />
    And then, after enduring all that could have been<br />
    Oh sweet land—<br />
    My smile<br />
    My reward,<br />
    Where all my love resides.  
    `

    painfullyTrue = `
    A regrettable, honest truth about life:<br />
    Leaving loved ones gets more difficult over time<br />
    And not easier with practice, as one would expect,<br />
    And I found it to be painfully true as I've aged.  
    `

    laSilla = `
    Cerro de la Silla<br />
    The Saddle,<br />
    Nest of the morning Mexico sun,<br />
    Stalwart reminder of a proud tradition,<br />
    Homage to a struggling culture,<br />
    Signpost of the Sierra Madre Oriental range.<br />
    A mountain of hope.  
    `

    timeAndAgain = `
    Tender, tender, time and again<br />
    Her love like the morning sun—<br />
    Warming hope in flowers stretched long for praise.<br />
    She smiles in the pale dawn light sneaking past wicker wood shades.<br />
    Her breath is slow and free now.<br />
    Wind whistles at the trees<br />
    Shadowing pictures on the wall, and<br />
    Hiding footprints in the sand of late night walks from the sea.<br />
    We reach to hold hands on those walks,<br />
    So many days the very same way.<br />
    Like in Idaho<br />
    On the brown basalt canyon rim above the river,<br />
    With the brave blue sky<br />
    And sage in the air,<br />
    Birds swirling to land in the rocks,<br />
    Holding my wife's hand,<br />
    Her hair waving across my face with the breeze.<br />
    A desert orchestra of possibilities before us.   
    `

    lastBreathLeavesYou = `
    You don't have the answers.<br />
    Everything you expect to happen might not.<br />
    Life makes no guarantees.<br />
    Existence is triumphantly strange,<br />
    Our eyes see different things<br />
    Both are true, yet incomplete.<br />
    Be forever wary of people's intentions,<br />
    Their egoic efforts are orchestrated too.<br />
    Learn to treasure your anonymity.<br />
    Each morning is a new chance<br />
    The possibilities eternal,<br />
    So stand tall and be your better self.<br />
    Breathe in the present moment—<br />
    Happiness is awareness and acceptance,<br />
    Joy is in the small things.<br />
    And when your last breath leaves you<br />
    Hope that you know love.   
    `

    shiftingSeas = `
    Hearts yearn for a home<br />
    And feelings heal bearing new scars,<br />
    Altering the courses we travel<br />
    In our journey to the stars.<br />
    Golden moonrise sea shine<br />
    Calms stormy oceans of worry,<br />
    Rolling with the swelling waves<br />
    Helps ebb our need to hurry.<br />
    The smallest drops of water unite<br />
    To create the current’s force,<br />
    Blue bliss upon the shifting seas<br />
    My thoughts cannot divorce.<br />
    Sailors know the ocean’s fury<br />
    Sailors know the ocean’s charms,<br />
    Gusting dreams on windy waters<br />
    Listing away from landlocked harms.  
    `

    nunavut = `
    Inukshuk stone elders, eying<br />
    Arctic blue waters, on<br />
    Polar permafrost planets, with<br />
    More mosquitoes than stars.<br />
    Roaming wild eaters, searching<br />
    Frozen white deserts, above<br />
    Precious rare minerals, near<br />
    Swimming lake-trout and char.  
    `

    falconWings = `
    It was a scorching bright blue<br />
    The sky that day<br />
    With a steady west wind howling by.<br />
    The desert's grey dirt swirled dancing<br />
    Sagebrush ruffled and waved without pause,<br />
    As a young jack merlin leaped airborne<br />
    Not for his prey, but applause.<br />
    Cotton ball clouds cast shadows below<br />
    Critters raced around just to survive,<br />
    And up in the air soared that merlin so high<br />
    Happy with falcon wings and the ride.<br />
    The wind blew, and gust, and eddied, and sheared<br />
    Teaching the jack merlin about grace.   
    `

    transientCurrents = `
    Learn to read the river.<br />
    Watch the double back<br />
    Downstream of the boulder.<br />
    See the green glassy waves.<br />
    Be the river swell,<br />
    Then exhale.<br />
    Align yourself along the seams<br />
    Of the transient currents<br />
    Roiled in the narrowing canyon.<br />
    Two paddle strokes<br />
    River water in your veins.<br />
    The sun sets, orange and bright,<br />
    Water like time flows downstream.<br />
    Campfire memories on riverside beaches<br />
    Shooting stars, whiskey, and dreams.   
    `

    peacefulAcquiescence = `
    Desert knows no tomorrow<br />
    Doesn't mind what happens today<br />
    Can't remember the hailing, stormy winds<br />
    Nor the birdsong's tribute in the amber sweet morning calm.<br />
    Pervasive sage grows green strong… then withers<br />
    Dying dirt swirls freely… then settles<br />
    Burning sun sends its love unrestrained.<br />
    Desert knows no tomorrow,<br />
    Only peaceful acquiescence to barren brown plains.  
    `

    shadeTree = `
    Hot,<br />
    Like a late August<br />
    Shade tree<br />
    Southern Idaho afternoon.<br />
    Sipping iced drinks from colorful plastic patio chairs,<br />
    Kids leaping over spinning sprinklers<br />
    Dripping wet with desert laughter and sun—<br />
    Immersed in the innocent freedom of frivolous play—<br />
    Spirited blades of green grass stuck between their flighty toes,<br />
    Birds along the cedar fence cheering<br />
    Tree shadows obediently shifting<br />
    Below a painter's stroke of wispy cirrus clouds<br />
    Fading to stationary blue.  
    `

    wantingCeaselessly = `
    Upslope wind flutters the beige-grey grasses<br />
    Dancing hillside with their rising pink sun god.<br />
    Squirrels shuffle 'round the rocks<br />
    Maple trees whisper their leafy life song,<br />
    Clouds chalk party.<br />
    I watch<br />
    I listen<br />
    As my skin glows warm<br />
    Breathing the warm wind,<br />
    Connected in time and place to now.<br />
    Some never open their eyes to the simple things,<br />
    Trapped in their own narrative<br />
    Lost to the voice in their head<br />
    Chasing dreams that never come<br />
    Wanting ceaselessly<br />
    Missing what is…<br />
    Untethered to the joy of now.<br />
    And the grass sways merrily.
